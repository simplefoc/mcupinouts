# STM32 Family Pinout

This page contains a list of pinout information for each subfamily of STM32 variants.

This page is automatically generated from the [STM32duino](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32) repository. This webpage has been generated using version [2.7.1](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32/releases).

This page is intended to be used for quick search of available PWM timers and ADC channels for a given STM32 family and subfamily. The information is extracted from the `PeripheralPins.c` file of the STM32duino repository. The `variant_*.cpp` files are used to provide the variant names for each subfamily. The `variant_generic.cpp` file is used as a generic variant for each subfamily.

## How to Use It

1. Navigate to the STM32 family and subfamily of interest using the provided links.
2. Click on the subfamily link to view the pinout information for that specific STM32 variant.
3. Use the provided information to identify available PWM timers and ADC channels for your project.
